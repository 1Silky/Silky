# YouTube Comments
This program retrieves comments from YouTube videos (note that you have to use your own YouTube API). After retrieving comments, firstly the gender based on commenter's name is predicted, and secondly the sentiment of a comment is predicted as well. For those purposes different neural networks are used.
